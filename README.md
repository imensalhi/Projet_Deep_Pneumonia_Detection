# Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning 🩺

This project applies **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.  
Three architectures were compared:

- **DenseNet121** – 88.78% accuracy  
- **MobileNetV2** – 90.06% accuracy (best model)  
- **Custom CNN (from scratch)** – 86.45% accuracy  

## 🧠 Main Technologies
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Deep Learning, Image Augmentation  

## 📈 Results
MobileNetV2 achieved the best performance while being lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for medical AI applications in low-resource environments.

## 📊 Project Files
- `DenseNet121.py`: implementation of the DenseNet121 model  
- `MobileNetV2.py`: implementation of the MobileNetV2 model  
- `CNNpersonnalise_FromScratch.py`: custom CNN built from scratch
